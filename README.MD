## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which includes npm)
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed and running.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2.  **Setup the Server:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the server directory
    cd server

    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Setup the Client:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the client directory from the root folder
    cd client

    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    ```

### Environment Variables

The server requires a `.env` file to store sensitive information.

1.  Create a `.env` file in the `/server` directory.
2.  Add the following variables:

    ```env
    # .env
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
    PORT=5000
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Server:**
    ```bash
    # In the /server directory
    npm start
    ```
    The server will be running on `http://localhost:5000` (or the port you specified).

2.  **Start the Client:**
    ```bash
    # In the /client directory
    npm run dev
    ```
    The React development server will start, and you can view the application in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.
